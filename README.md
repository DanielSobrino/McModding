# McModding
This week I started modding for minecraft (fabric) in java with the IntelliJ IDEA. 
First I started with my bear_meat mod, which focuses on making polar bears more useful by giving them meat drops and fur which you'll make armor out of.
On the third day I wanted to begin making entities, so I had the idea to create a paper plane which u can craft and throw to activate mecanisms, hit your foes or just make it fly.
