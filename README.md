# McModding
This week I started modding for minecraft (fabric) in java with IntelliJ IDEA. 
First I started with my bear_meat mod, which focuses on making polar bears more useful by giving them meat drops and fur which you'll make armor out of.
On the third day I started making a paperplane you can craft and throw, with fake physics.
